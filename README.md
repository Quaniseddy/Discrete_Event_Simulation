# Discrete_Event_Simulation

• Provide simulation of server’s operation under different designs in Python.

• Could be used to test and design settings like call center, queuing, hardware ultiliastion, any setting involves server(s) handling incoming task or event.

• Using matplotlib to plot graph to present system performance and to validate results or patterns, increase system efficiency, lower cost, and increase service rate.

• Using AMPL tool to calculate system design variables for desire performance.
